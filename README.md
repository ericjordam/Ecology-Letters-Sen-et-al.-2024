# Ecology-Letters-Sen-et-al.-2024
In this R script we submit the code for the manuscript "Benthic remineralization under future Arctic conditions: evaluating the potential for changes in carbon sequestration in warming sediments" by Sen et al. to Ecology Letters.
For some data downloads the dois of published data sets are presented inside the R script from where the data where retrieved. For some analyses, the excel/csv files needed to run the code are submitted as attachment files.
Make sure to download all data from data repositories in the same folder where the present R script is downloaded to.
